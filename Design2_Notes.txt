Treatment: Notified that if the section came with/without a bonus

Assumptions:
- All subjects receive the treatment, only CACE
- No anticipation effect, ignore treatment allocated after the current session
- Ignore treatment allocated two rounds ago

- cannot simply compare all treatment rounds to control rounds because the probability of being assigned treatment is much higher in the later sessions, when subjects are warmed up to the task already.

Attrition:
Write about or resolve any differential attrition
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To provide an overview for the design 1 results, the estimated effect of pay rate on HIT accuracy is insignificant when all data is pooled together. When publishing order is accounted for, we observe significant heterogeneous treatment effect and baseline difference. The same significance pattern is observed for both linear and logistic regression models. Randomization inference, by simulating the sampling distribution under the sharp-null, reinforces the linear regression result that the estimated ATE is insignificant with a more conservative p-value. Lastly, time spent per HIT is considered as a secondary outcome. The corresponding ATE is estimated to be negative but both statistically and practically insignificant. When publishing order is accounted for, we again observe statistically significant but practically insignificant heterogeneous treatment effect and baseline difference.

Therefore, with our best estimate, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that average treatment effect of pay rate on accuracy or time spent per HIT is zero. Rather, there are strong evidence of unaccounted effects which differentiated outcomes of the two publishing orders. For instance, the kind of turkers who sign up for low paying HITs on Saturday mornings may invest less effort on HITs than the kind who sign for the same HITs on Sunday afternoon, but our available time frame and budget prevented us from running experiments on enough weekends to determine such effect. Perhaps, the November 11th (Veteran's day) weekend is different from the November 18th weekend for American turkers, which is again unlikely because turkers came from multiple countries and we published our HITs on UTC. Finally, we investigated if publish order 1 has exhausted the pool of turkers or affected the baseline of turkers who participated in publish order 2. On its AMT platform, Amazon highlighted its service for providing access to over 500,000 turkers from over 190 countries. Even if all of them work part-time, and only 5% of them are active, 25,000 turkers are still accessible to us. It is unlikely that recruiting 749 turkers (405 who completed the HIT and 344 who viewed but left the HIT), that is less than 3% of 25,000 turkers or 0.1% of proclaimed 500,000 turkers, would have shifted the baseline for turkers recruited in publish order 2. Being wary of this result, we proceed to the analysis of design 2 in which subjects are defined as turkers rather than as HITs, and randomization occurs only after turkers signed up for an HIT. The experiment was also launched in a single posting on a single weekend. As such, selection bias, publish orders or weekend effects will not be of concern.

To provide an overview for the design 2 results, the estimated effect of bonuses on a turker performance is statistically and practically insignificant in all three of our estimation approaches. We looked at the overall bonus effects by comparing different treatment groups using linear and logistic regression, investigated more granular bonus effects both by group and by session by taking full advantage of a stepped-wedge design, and we estimated both immediate, lagged and their combined effect by invoking the no-anticipation assumption and assuming no within-subject spill-over effect from more than one session. All inference approaches failed to reject the null hypothesis that bonus has zero effect on a turker's performance. On the other hand, bonuses' negative effect on the average time spent on an HIT is significant, but counter-intuitive. Our linear model suggested that being assigned to receive bonus only in the third session or all sessions tend to shorten turkers' time spent by two to three minutes.

Finally, we observed differential attrition based on covariates related to turkers' prior exposure or life experience with dogs. This remains a threat to the unbiasedness of our estimated treatment effect. We will discuss potential solutions for a future experiment in the next section.

In this project, we look at the relationship between reward and work quality through the different perspective of employers and economists. We use two experimental designs, one being a traditional between-subject experiment and the other being a stepped-wedge design, to analysis effects of higher pay rate on returned work quality and effects of bonuses on worker performance. We utilize the functionalities of the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform and Qualtrics survey tools to randomly assign a human intelligence task to different pay rate in the first experimental design, and a turker to different bonus conditions in the second experimental design. Both experimental setups require turkers to correctly identify a set of 48 dog breed classification questions. Independent two-sample t-tests, linear and logistic regression models, and randomization inference are used to perform inference on data collected from the running the first experimental design. Linear and logistic regression models, general linear hypothesis, weighted difference-in-means and simulation of potential outcome schedules are used to perform inference on data collected from the running the second experimental design. Results from both experiments fails to reject the null hypothesis that higher reward has zero effect on work quality nor worker performance. Through out the experiment, we observe that tasks attached with higher rewards tend to be claimed much sooner but no effect is observed on the returned task accuracies.
