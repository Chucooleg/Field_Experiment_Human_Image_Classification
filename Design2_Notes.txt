Treatment: Notified that if the section came with/without a bonus

Assumptions:
- All subjects receive the treatment, only CACE
- No anticipation effect, ignore treatment allocated after the current session
- Ignore treatment allocated two rounds ago

- cannot simply compare all treatment rounds to control rounds because the probability of being assigned treatment is much higher in the later sessions, when subjects are warmed up to the task already.

Attrition:
Write about or resolve any differential attrition

Design 1 : Clustered SE 
For the main design as well

Design 2 : Check attrition, or fill-in missing data for extreme case (p.241 worst case scenario)
Design 2 : sub group analysis check heterogeneity with interaction effects FE P.392 -->F-test to see if they are all the same. Individual t-test with multiple comparison correction to check if individually significant?
